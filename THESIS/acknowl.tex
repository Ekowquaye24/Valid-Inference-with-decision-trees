\chapter*{Acknowledgements}

First and foremost I am extremely grateful to my supervisor, Dr. Xiaogang Su for his invaluable advice, continuous support, and patience during my study. His immense knowledge and plentiful experience have encouraged me in all the time of my academic research and daily life. My gratitude extends to the faculty of Mathematical Science for the funding opportunity to undertake my studies at the Department of Mathematical Sciences, the University of Texas at El Paso. Additionally, I would like to express gratitude to Dr. Suneel B Chatla and Dr. Wen-Yee Lee for their treasured support which was really influential in shaping my thesis fundings and critiquing my results. I also thank Dr. Jacob Setorglo of the University of Cape Coast and Mr. Carlos Quaye for their mentorship, without their tremendous understanding and encouragement in the past few years, it would be impossible for me to complete my study. Finally to my family and friends for their encouragement and support all through my studies.
